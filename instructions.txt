TDD++:
* Incorporate our ABET Pars project to TDD++. (MAYBE, that is still too broad, what specifically will you narrow down to? What feature(s)?)
* Demonstrate ability to create full coverage unit tests and functional tests.  
    TDD++ functionality is for an institution to input program educational and student objectives.
     (OKAY, but be certain of this scope by the 4th - Dropbox going up today/tomorrow)
* Will receive a grading rubric by Nov 4th, which would give better guidance  into what is expected. (yes, but this is very reflective of what Percival finished with at Chapter 7)
* Send URL to the repo we end up using to manage the code for our TDD++ once figured out to Dr. Babb. (YES, please)   


Test-Driven Development++ - develop an original Django/Python application whose scope is similar to Chapter 8 of Percival.  Here are some parameters:

Full unit test coverage
Full functional/acceptance test coverage
Views/Templates
Url routing
Models
BE MINDFUL of scope - for instance, if you are considering reusing features of the ABET PARS system, please be mindful of the scope of feature(s) you implement - you are NOT WRITING THE ABET PARS system in full (that's far too large of a scope)
